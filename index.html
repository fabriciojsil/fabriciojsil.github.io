                <h4>Who am I?</h4>
                <p> My name is Fabrício Jean Silva, 
                    I am graduated in Analysis and Software Development, interested in new technologies and
                    working with innovative systems.
                    I'm concerned about code quality and process efficiency. I'm a good team player and I'm
                    always trying to spread the knowledge I have and learn from it.
                    During my professional career I've worked with a wide variety of programming languages
                    such as Javascript, Java and Python.</p>

            <div class="col s12 l12 m12">
                <p> Dígitro Tecnologia is a big Brazilian company which works in many sectors such as public
                    security and call centers management. </p>
                <h6> Full Stack Developer - October 2015 / Nowadays </h5>
                <p>I work mainly with NodeJS, Web Components, and Java 7.
                    We use NodeJS to crawl as much information as possible from users across some
                    social networks such as Facebook, Linkedin, and Instagram. This information is used
                    to follow/track user's fingerprints and understand potentially dangerous behavior or
                    even discover what some user is doing on the internet based on friends/relations,
                    pages liked, posts and so on. </p>
                    <p> When I entered the company I drove the team to refactor many modules, write unit
                    tests and taught them how to properly debug NodeJS applications.
                    I also suggested and implemented a KPI controller to understand better our metrics.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                    Among the technologies used are:
                    Grunt.js and Gulp.js as task runners,
                    Mocha and chai.js as a test framework and assertions library,
                    Mokito to write java unit tests.</p>

                <p>I worked ​ as a Java developer in a project called ​ Participa+ , which was designed to
                    improve the communication between politicians and the population. The software we
                    developed there also helped to execute a lot of common tasks from politicians and its
                    assessors. </p>
                <p>
                    We used Java 7 as the main programming language, JSF, PrimeFaces and the
